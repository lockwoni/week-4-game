# Crystals Collector Game

*Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp Week 4 Homework*

Here's how the app works:
* Four crystals are displayed as buttons on the page.
* A random number is shown at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal, a specific amount of points is added to the player's total score. This amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
	* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number and all the crystals will have four new hidden values. 

This app runs in the browser and features HTML pages dynamically updated with the jQuery library.
